## Task 4 — 2026-01-26

**Status:** complete

**Reasoning:** Task 4 requires creating the output/teaching_panels/ directory to store PNG exports from the PDF generation scripts. Added a .gitkeep file to ensure the empty directory is tracked in git.

**Action:** Created output/teaching_panels/ directory with .gitkeep file

**Results:**
- Directory output/teaching_panels/ created
- .gitkeep file added to track empty directory in git
- Directory will be used by Tasks 2 and 3 for PNG exports

**Checks:**
- [x] Directory `output/teaching_panels/` exists after running either PDF script
- [x] Directory is created automatically if missing (via mkdir -p)
