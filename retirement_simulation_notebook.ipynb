    "\n",
    "### 1. Duration Matching Protects Funded Status\n",
    "\n",
    "Duration matching ensures that when interest rates change, assets and liabilities move together. This protects the **funded status** (Assets/Liabilities ratio).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it introduces more **portfolio volatility** because long-duration bonds are more volatile than money market instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Variable Consumption Eliminates Default Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "By spending a percentage of wealth rather than a fixed amount, the retiree can never run out of money (mathematically impossible).\n",
    "\n",

    "|----------|------------|------|\n",
    "| Duration Matching | Interest rate risk | Higher portfolio volatility |\n",
    "| Variable Consumption | Sequence-of-returns risk | Consumption uncertainty |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Low-Rate Environment Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "When rates are already low (near the floor):\n",
